Overall Look and Feel of UFinder
===============================

Our website will have a scrolling page layout, with different sections appearing as you scroll down. We plan to have a flat website, with flat buttons and square corners.
The website will also feature a header than contains links to each part of the website. Finally, our website will contain smooth animations.

Colours
========
For UFinder, we plan to use cool colours, with bright ones for the text to provide contrast.

We plan to mainly use rgba(52, 73, 94, 1) along with white for our website.

Typography
==========
We will be using Poppins from Google Fonts.

Links
=====
Links will not be underlined and will become underlined with an animation when the user hovers over them. 
They will be on a header that stays in the same place during scrolling.


Buttons
=======
Buttons will be flat designed using the chosen colors outlined above.

Video
======
We plan to have a promotional video featured on our site.
